# If you wanted to keep the simplified data in repo as per previous context (we moved it to dashboard/public/data anyway)
# But let's check: users said "exclude datasets folder".
# The user said "dataset @[datasets/spatial/sigungu] ... files require login so do not sync datasets folder".
# The "export" folder contains processed data which technically isn't the raw restricted data.
# However, usually large geojson files might be better excluded if they are huge, but these seem to be the "product".
# The user specifically said "datasets folder".
# I will strictly ignore `datasets/`.
